# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This project uses deep learning to classify brain MRI images into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**.

The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provides a web interface using **Streamlit** to allow image uploads or URL-based prediction.
